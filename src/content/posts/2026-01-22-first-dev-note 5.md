## Context

I want a place where I can think in public while learning and building things.

This is not a blog.
This is not a tutorial platform.

It’s a developer journal.

## What I expect from this

- Write without polishing every sentence
- Capture decisions and mistakes
- Track progress over time

If this works, I’ll keep going.
If not — I’ll stop without regret.
